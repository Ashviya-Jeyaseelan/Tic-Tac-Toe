# Tic-Tac-Toe
This Tic Tac Toe project is a simple multiplayer console-based game programmed in Python. The game follows the standard rules of Tic Tac Toe where Player 1 is represented by 'X' and Player 2 is represented by 'O', taking turns to enter their moves by selection the numbered spaces on the board until they obtain three in a row.

The Python game incorporates fundamental programming concepts, including functions to print the board, handle player moves, and verify game-ending conditions.
